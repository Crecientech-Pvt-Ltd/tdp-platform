# Disease-independent data

**Disease-independent** data DO NOT vary with different diseases, including [Pathway](disease-independent-data/pathway.mdx) (_Pathway membership from MSigDB_), [Druggability](disease-independent-data/druggability.mdx) (_Druggability score form MantisML and Open Target_), [Tissue Enrichment](disease-independent-data/tissue-enrichment.mdx) (_Tissue-specific expression from GTEX and HPA_) and [Database](disease-independent-data/database.mdx) (_Membership in various database_).
