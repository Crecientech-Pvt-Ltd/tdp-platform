# Scripts for Data Pre-processing & Uploading to database

> For developers:
> You can automate the data pre-processing and uploading to the database using the scripts provided in this directory by providing necessary options to run script without human interactions. Use the command for help `node <script-name> [-h | --help]` to know more about the options available.

## Q: Do you have unnormlized protein-protein interaction data?

1. Run the following scripts to normalize the data & provide the required input in interactive mode.:

   ```bash
   npm run protein-normalizer-txt2csv
   # OR
   node protein-normalizer-txt2csv.js # with options
   ```

2. Now, protein to gene mapping is required to upload the data to the database. Run the following script to map protein to gene & provide the required input in interactive mode.:

   ```bash
   npm run protein2gene
   # OR
   node --max-old-space-size=6144 protein2gene.js # with options
   ```

## Database Seeding

### Seeding the Interaction data

> ðŸ’¡ **NOTE**  
> Before running the following scripts, make sure you have transferred the seeding data to the server.
>
> - To transfer files to the server, you can use the following command:
>
> ```bash
> # Transfer files to the server
> scp -r <source-path> <username>@<server-ip>:<destination-path>
> ```
>
> > ðŸ’¡ **NOTE**  
> > Replace `<destination-path>` with the path specified in the [docker-compose.yml](../docker-compose.yml) file.
> >
> > ```yaml
> > services:
> >   neo4j:
> >     ...
> >     volumes:
> >       - <destination-path>:/var/lib/neo4j/import
> > ```
>

Now, you can upload the data to the database. Run the following script to upload the data to the database & provide the required input in interactive mode.:

```bash
npm run gene-score-seed
# OR
node gene-score-seed.js # with options
```

### Seeding the Universal Data

Now, you can upload the universal data to the database. Run the following script to upload the data to the database & provide the required input in interactive mode.:

> ðŸ’¡ **NOTE**
> Before running the following scripts, make sure you have transferred the seeding data to the server. And csv data needs to be in the same folder as the script.

```bash
npm run gene-universal-seed
# OR
node gene-universal-seed.js # with options
```

### Reference Genome Update

Incase, you have a new reference genome data, you can update the reference genome data in the database. Run the following script to update the reference genome data in the database & provide the required input in interactive mode.:

```bash
npm run reference-genome-update
# OR
node reference-genome-update.js # with options
```

### Deleting Universal Data

Incase, you want to delete some of the universal data from the database. Run the following script to delete the universal data from the database & provide the required input in interactive mode.:

```bash
npm run gene-universal-delete
# OR
node gene-universal-deletion.js # with options
```

## FAQ

1. Q: How to install node.js and npm in linux system?

   A: Run the following commands to install node.js and npm in linux system:

   ```bash

2. Q: What is import directory of database?

   A: The import directory is the directory where the database looks for the files to import the data to the database.
   - For linux system, the default import directory is `/var/lib/neo4j/import`.
   - For windows system, the default import directory is `C:\Users\<username>\AppData\Neo4j\Relate\Data\dbmss\<dbms-id>\import`.
