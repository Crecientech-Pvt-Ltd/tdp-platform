# Genetics

**Odd ratio or Beta-values from population studies, ranging from `-1` to `1`**

Genetics data in knowledge base is imported from Open Targets portal, and NHGRI GWAS catalog. The data is formatted to map SNPs level statistics to gene-level statistics i.e. odd-ratio or beta-value.

We have 4 different diseases — PSP, ALS, FTD and OI.

## PSP

## FTD

## ALS & OI

ALS and OI Genetics data are from Open Targets. We use **\{**_score type_**\}\_\{source\}\_\{disease id\}\_\{publication id}** as the format, for example, “beta\_otgenetics\_MONDO0004976\_PMID19451621”, shown as below:
