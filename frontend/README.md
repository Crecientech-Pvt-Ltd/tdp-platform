This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, install the dependencies:

```bash
npm install
# or
yarn
# or
pnpm
# or
bun
```

Then, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

Here, we use `app` router for building the tool, while `pages` router for building the documentation. So, ensure that conflicting routes are not present in both the routers.

> [!NOTE] Pages router do not work with turbopack, so you need to use the `dev` command to run the project if wish to see the documentation, else you can use `dev:turbo` command for developing just the tool.

## Disclaimer

While building this project in Dockerized form or publishing the website in production, I encourage you to upload videos (as maintaining it in `git lfs` is going to cost it), please keep all the related videos in [this folder](/public/video/). All the videos are currently uploaded in this [gdrive folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1LvPTY8Z559shYoWTaSOHFuWOFKGG8QHv), you can download them from there and upload them in the above-mentioned folder.
